This code takes an expression and turns it into an expression tree. Then prints out the inorder traversal of the tree to confirm that it was created properly.
Prints out the postorder traversal of the tree to get the postfix expression. Does partial evaluation, and keep track of which unbound variables appear in the expression.
Gives the result of the expression if does not have any unbound variables.
